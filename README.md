# .vimrc Configuration
 My .vimrc Configuration.
 Before using my .vimrc, you need to install vimplug.
 Google search: Vimplug github page.
Also, search up each plugin and check out the installation guide for them to work correctly.
On YouTube, check out ThePrimeagen "Your first VimRC: How to setup your vim's vimrc" tutorial! It helped me out!
